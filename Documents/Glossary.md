### L.E.D (-s)

L.E.D stand for Light Emiting [Diode](#diode). It is a [semiconductor](#semiconductor) light source that emits light when current flows through it.

### Diode

A diode is a two-terminal electronic component that conducts current primarily in one direction (asymmetric conductance); it has low (ideally zero) [resistance](#resistance) in one direction, and high (ideally infinite) [resistance](#resistance) in the other.

### Semiconductor

A semiconductor material has an electrical conductivity value falling between that of a [conductor](#conductor), such as metallic copper, and an [insulator](#insulator), such as glass.

### Conductor

In physics and electrical engineering, a conductor is an object or type of material that allows the flow of electric current in one or more directions.

### Insulator

An electrical insulator is a material in which electric current does not flow freely.

### Resistance

The electrical resistance of an object is a measure of its opposition to the flow of electric current.
