### Hardware

Computer hardware includes the physical parts of a computer or an electronic system

### Software

Software is a set of computer programs and associated documentation and data.

### L.E.D (-s)

L.E.D stand for Light Emiting [Diode](#diode). It is a [semiconductor](#semiconductor) light source that emits light when current flows through it.

### Diode

A diode is a two-terminal electronic component that conducts current primarily in one direction (asymmetric conductance); it has low (ideally zero) [resistance](#resistance) in one direction, and high (ideally infinite) [resistance](#resistance) in the other.

### Semiconductor

A semiconductor material has an electrical conductivity value falling between that of a [conductor](#conductor), such as metallic copper, and an [insulator](#insulator), such as glass.

### Conductor

In physics and electrical engineering, a conductor is an object or type of material that allows the flow of electric current in one or more directions.

### Insulator

An electrical insulator is a material in which electric current does not flow freely.

### Resistance

The electrical resistance of an object is a measure of its opposition to the flow of electric current.

### Sensor (-s)

A sensor is a device that produces an output signal for the purpose of sensing a physical phenomenon. In the broadest definition, a sensor is a device, module, machine, or subsystem that detects events or changes in its environment and sends the information to other electronics, frequently a computer [processor](#processor).

### Processor

In computing and computer science, a processor or processing unit is an electrical component that performs operations

### LoRaWa Network

LoRa (from "long range") is a physical proprietary radio communication technique. It was developed by Cycleo, a company of Grenoble, France, later acquired by Semtech.

LoRaWAN defines the software communication protocol and system architecture. The continued development of the LoRaWAN protocol is managed by the open, non-profit LoRa Alliance, of which SemTech is a founding member.

### UpLink

An uplink is a telecommunications link sending from a device "up" to a server

### DownLink

A Downlink is a telecommunications link sending from a server "down" to a device

### Photoresistor

A photoresistor (also known as a Photocell, or light-dependent resistor, LDR, or photo-conductive cell) is a passive component that decreases resistance with respect to receiving luminosity (light) on the component's sensitive surface.

### Peer-to-Peer communication

Peer-to-peer (P2P) computing or networking is a distributed application architecture that partitions tasks or workloads between peers. Peers are equally privileged, equipotent participants in the network. They are said to form a peer-to-peer network.

### Micro controller

A microcontroller (MCU for microcontroller unit) is a small computer on a single VLSI [integrated circuit](#integrated-circuit) (IC) chip.

### Integrated circuit

An integrated circuit or monolithic integrated circuit (also referred to as an IC, a chip, or a microchip) is a set of electronic circuits on one small flat piece (or "chip") of semiconductor material, usually silicon.
