## Project Scope
This project was proposed by SignAll, a French company that has been manufacturing large luminous signage since 1962. They supply a large number of customers such as McDonald’s, Burger King, La Poste, Orange, AXA, Crédit Agricole, Total, etc. to name a few.

Their existing products are not connected therefore users must be on-site to know if the signage is on, functional, or out of order. Also, users cannot switch the signage on/off remotely (even when the law requires them to switch it off at a given time, when the shop closes for instance).

When the owner of the brand on the signage is not the same as the owner of the place (think of a Burger Kind’s restaurant for instance), the maintenance team from the brand does not know what is going on at the place where the signage is installed and must go on-site on a regular basis just to check if everything is working. This results in additional costs and damage to the brand when the signage if out of order for too long.

Lately, environmental concerns and cost of energy has increased the pressure on the manufacturer to produce more efficient solutions such as dimming the signage when it is getting dark or switch it off completely at a given time or when there is a shortage of electricity.

In other words, this project need to manage a set of L.E.Ds in order to control these remotly. That control shall include turning those said L.E.Ds ON or OFF and being able to dim the light therefore reducing the energy comsumption, all of that remotly. The device should also be able to work on is own, dim or turn OFF L.E.Ds at a given time of the day or depending of the ambiant light for exemple.
